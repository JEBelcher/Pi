cpu-temp.py
Uses a terminal session to provide temerature information
using the vcgencmd measure_temp function in a loop.

This ties up a termianal session to constantly update the CPU temperature so you 
must use another session to to stress test your Pi while observing the temperature
or just carry on with whatever you are doing.

Desktop-cpu-temp.py
This is a version for the Pi Desktop
While it displays the thermometer icon using Debian version: 11 Bullseye,
Debian version: 12 Bookworm displays a generic icon.  Maybe this will be sorted soon.

The PDF file gives more information.
